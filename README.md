> In this project we creted a clone of [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/)

![screenshot](./src/assets/main-screenshot.jpg)

We used HTML & CSS, including GRID, Flex-Box and media queries. The webpage is visually responsive for all formats including mobile and for you to test this you can right-click on your browser, click inspect and select the different grey bars at the top which will re-size and you will see how the layout changes and what disappears and pops up.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- VS Code
- Font Awesome Icons

## Preparation

Below you can see how we prepared our layout, the whole page layout is a GRID layout including the top main section and then the rest of the sections are used by Flex-Box. This gives us a nice idea of where everything is and so that we can keep it tidy.
